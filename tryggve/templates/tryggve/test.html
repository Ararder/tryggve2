                The COVIDMENT program brings together leading researchers in the Nordic countries and Estonia through already established collaborations where state-of-the-art methodologies and research infrastructures will be leveraged to elucidate the impact of COVID-19. This program is put forward by an already established, Horizon2020-funded, consortium (CoMorMent; grant no. 847776) using data from national registries, biobanks, and cohorts on psychiatric- and cardiometabolic outcomes for improved understanding of the comorbidities between psychiatric- and cardiometabolic conditions.

                <h1> COVIDMENT</h1>

    The COVIDMENT project was designed to significantly advance current knowledge of mental morbidity trajectories in the COVID-19 pandemic, by utilizing large, data-rich population-based registry resources, biobanks, and ongoing questionnaire data with longitudinal follow-up, biobanks, and COVID-19 cohorts with questionnaire data (est. > 565.144 individuals). This large-scale collaborative project between countries and Estonia has been awarded roughly NOK 13 million in funding by NordForsk for two years (project no. 105668).
